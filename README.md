## Project Description

Our group aims to build a UChicago-based platform to consolidate resources and student experiences centered on navigating mental health as a student. While googling "UChicago counselling" will help one find many university provided resources, certain issues are still lacking concentrated and concise information (help navigating leave of abscences or inpatient psychiatric care off campus). One particular area that we think this projet would do well in exploring is in connecting UChicago students with going through things with others--whether it be for advice or in other ways. 

We hope to create an online space for student voices to fill these crucial gaps in information.
