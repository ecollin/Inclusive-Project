## Project Description

Our group aims to build a UChicago-based platform to consolidate resources and student experiences centered on navigating mental health as a student. While googling “UChicago counselling” will help one find many university provided resources, certain issues are still lacking concentrated and concise information (help navigating leave of absences or inpatient psychiatric care off campus). One particular area that we think this project would do well in exploring is in connecting UChicago students having a tough time at school with others who have made it through that.

We hope to create an online space for student voices that will fill crucial gaps in information. We've chosen the group name "Anti-depressant" because of this topic choice.

Group members; Lucas Du, Enrique Collin, Thorence Anderskow, Oliver Zhao, Danny Kim.
